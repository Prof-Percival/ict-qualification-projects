Zuma Entertainment organized a jazz festival which was attended by 500 people. 

The price of a ticket to the festival was determined according to the age table shown below:

		Age 				Price
	Less than 16 years 			R50
	From 16 and not more than 55 years 	R55
	More than 55 years 			R25

Write a program that will accept the personâ€™s age to determine how much they had to pay for the 
concert ticket. 

Your program should also determine and display the total amount the company made.
