Consider the following data:
	101
	Lance Smith
	65 78 65 89 25 98 -999
	102
	Cynthia Marker
	87 34 89 99 26 78 64 34 -999
	103
	Sheila Mann
	23 99 98 97 26 78 100 63 87 23 -999
	104
	David Arora
	62 35 78 99 12 93 19 -999
	...

The number -999 at the end of a line acts as a sentinel and therefore is not part of the data.

Assume that this data describes certain candidates seeking the student councilâ€™s presidential seat. 

For each candidate the data is in the following form:
	- ID
	- Name
	- Votes

The objective is to find the total number of votes received by each candidate.

We assume that the data is input from the file, Exp_5_21.txt, of unknown size. 

We also assume that the input file has been opened using the Scanner variable inFile.

Because the input file is of an unspecified length, we use an EOF-controlled while loop.
For each candidate, the first data item is the ID of the type, say, int, on a line by itself;
the second data item is the name, which may consist of more than one word; and the
third line contains the votes received from the various departments.

To read the ID we use the method nextInt; to read the name we use the method nextLine. 
Notice that after reading the ID, the reading marker is after the ID and the character after the ID is the newline character. 
Therefore, after reading the ID, the reading marker is after the ID and at the newline character (of the line containing the ID).
The method nextLine reads until the end of the line. 

Therefore, if we read the name immediately after reading the ID,
	- Then the method nextLine will position the reading marker after the newline character following the ID,
	- And nothing will be stored in the variable name. 

Because the reading marker is just before the name, 
	-if we use the method nextInt to read the voting data, the program will terminate with an error message.

Therefore, it follows that to read the name, we must discard the newline character after the ID, which we can do using the method nextLine.
