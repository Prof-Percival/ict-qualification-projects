Consider the following data residing in a file:

	65 78 65 89 25 98 -999
	87 34 89 99 26 78 64 34 -999
	23 99 98 97 26 78 100 63 87 23 -999
	62 35 78 99 12 93 19 -999

The number -999 at the end of each line acts as a sentinel and, therefore, it is not part of the data. 

Our objective is to find the sum of the numbers in each line and output the sum.

Moreover, assume that this data is to be read from a file, say, Exp_5_20.txt. 

We assume that the input file has been opened using the input file stream variable inFile.
