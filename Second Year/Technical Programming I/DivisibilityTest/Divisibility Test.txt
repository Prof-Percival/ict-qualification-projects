						DIVISIBILITY TEST BY 3 AND 9

Suppose that m and n are integers and m is nonzero. 
Then m is called a divisor of n if n = mt for some integer t; that is, when m divides n, the remainder is 0.

	Let n = ak ak-1 ak-2...a1 a0 be an integer. 
	Let s = ak + ak-1 + ak-2 +...+a1 + a0 be the sum of the digits of n. 

It is known that n is divisible by 3 and 9 if s is divisible by 3 and 9. 

In other words, an integer is divisible by 3 and 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3 and 9.

For example, suppose n = 27193257. Then, s = 2+7+1+9+3+2+5+7 = 36.

Because 36 is divisible by both 3 and 9, it follows that 27193257 is divisible by both 3 and 9.\


Next, we write a program that determines whether a positive integer is divisible by 3 and 9
	- By first finding the sum of its digits and then checking whether the sum is divisible by 3 and 9.

To find the sum of the digits of a positive integer, we need to extract each digit of the number. 
	- Consider the number 951372. Note that 951372 % 10 = 2, which is the last digit of 951372. 
	- Also note that 951372 / 10 = 95137, that is, when the number is divided by 10, it removes the last digit. 

Next, we repeat this process on the number 95137. Of course, we need to add the extracted digits.

Suppose that sum and num are int variables and the positive integer is stored in num. 

We thus have the following algorithm to find the sum of the digits:

sum = 0;
do
{
sum = sum + num % 10; //extract the last digit and add it to sum

num = num / 10; //remove the last digit
}
while (num > 0);

Using this algorithm, we can write the following program that uses a do...while loop to implement the preceding divisibility test algorithm.
