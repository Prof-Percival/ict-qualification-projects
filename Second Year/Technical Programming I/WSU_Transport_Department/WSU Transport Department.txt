A Walter Sisulu University Transport Department has requested you to develop an application 
that will assist computer transport claims from staff members who use their cars to travel to work. 

The application specification is as follows:  

The claim rates are typically based on the engine capacity of the vehicle number. For example:

1 - 1600 litres            2.50 Rands per kilometer
1601 - 2500 litres         3.00 Rands per kilometre
2501 - 3500 litres	   3.50 Rands per kilometre
3501 - 4500 litres	   4.00 Rands per kilometre
over 4500                  4.50 Rands per kilometre

Create a transport claims application that prompts the user for the engine capacity of the vehicle and then determines the rate per kilometer. 

The program then prompts the user for the number kilometers travelled and computes the total amount claimed. 

Total amount claimed = Rands per kilometer * kilometers travelled

Application output should look similar to:

	Enter the engine capacity of the vehicle: 2500
	Rands per kilometer is: R3.00

	Enter the number of kilometers travelled: 1000
        Total amount claimed is: R3000
