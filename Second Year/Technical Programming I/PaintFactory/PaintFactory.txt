A paint factory is taking orders for different colours of paint. 

The program must perform the following for 100 customers.

One customer can only order one colour.
	
Details are:

	COLOUR	CODE	PRICE PER LITRE
	WHITE	WT	R20.00
	GREEN	GN	R35.00
	SILVER	SR	R45.00  

Write a program which will accept the code of the colour wanted and the number of litres.

A customer will receive a discount of 10% off the calculated price if the calculated price is more than R1000.00

If the data is not valid, display a message which explains the error(s) and do not do the calculations.

Your program should calculate and display the final price the customer must pay after discount (if any) has been subtracted.
