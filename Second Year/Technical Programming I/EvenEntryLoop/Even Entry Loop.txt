Write an application that asks a user to type an even number or the sentinel value 999 to stop. 

When the user types an even number, display the message “Good job!” and then ask for another input. 

When the user types an odd number, display an error message and then ask for another input. 

When the user types the sentinel value 999, end the program. 

Save the file as EvenEntryLoop.java.
