Write a program to compute the amount of salary increase (raise) and the new salary for KLM employees. 

The program should also display the total cost to company after salary increase (total  amount of all salaries that the company will need to pay employees for one month). 

The application will prompt the user to enter the current salary and the performance rating. 

The rating is a string value  of “Excellent”, “Very-Good”, “Good”, “Fair”, or “Poor”. 

Please follow the list below to assign the appropriate percent increase based on the reported performance:
	• Excellent performance will increase the salary by 10%.
	• Very good performance will increase the salary by 6%.
	• Good performance will increase the salary by 4%.
	• Fair performance will increase the salary by 1.5%.
	• Poor performance will receive no salary increase.

The application should check the entered information. 

If the rating of performance is not one of the listed rating values above:
	a feedback message “Illegal response, no raise given” will be displayed, the raise will equal zero and salary will not change. 

This will be repeated until “ZZZ” is entered to terminate.

An example of working application or sample output:
	Please enter the performance rating (Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, or Poor): Excellent
	Please enter the current salary: 50000
	Current Salary: R50000.00
	Performance Rating: Excellent
	Amount of Raise: R5000.00
	The New Salary: R55000.00

Then when the loop exits it displays the total cost to company. Total Cost To Company per month: R
