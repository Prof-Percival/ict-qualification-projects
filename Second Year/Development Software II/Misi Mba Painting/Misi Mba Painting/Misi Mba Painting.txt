Misi Mba runs a business doing painting jobs for clients. 

He wants a program which will help him work out how much paint he needs to buy. 

He will need 5 litres to cover a wall of 15 square metres. 

	He wants to input the following data: height of wall (in metres), width of wall (in metres).

	When he clicks a CALCULATE button, the program must first validate the data as follows:
		- height and weight (//correction// width) must be numeric and greater than 0
		
	If the data is valid:
		- the program must call a function which calculates and returns the litres of paint needed (rounded to 0 decimal places)
						Hint: first calculate the area of the wall.
		- Then calculate the no of litres. Formula: numlitres = (area / 15) * 5

In the calling procedure:
	a. the answer must be shown in a read-only text box
	b. the answer must be added to the total litres needed and shown in a read-only text box for TOTAL
	c. the input text boxes must be disabled

If any of the data is invalid, an error message must be shown and the calculation, accumulation and displays, etc. must not be done.

When he clicks a NEXT button:
	- The program must call a general procedure which clears all input and output (except the TOTAL litres)
	- Enables the input text boxes and sets focus to the height text box.

The program must end when he clicks an exit button.

DO THE FOLLOWING:
1. Identify all of the controls needed and be able to explain your reason for choosing those controls. 

2. Draw the GUI for the form. Show the name of each control.

3. Write the VB program
