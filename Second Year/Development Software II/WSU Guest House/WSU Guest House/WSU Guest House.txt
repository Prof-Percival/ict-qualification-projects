WSU Guest House has three types of rooms for accommodation of guests: 
			(single, double and suite)

The room charges per day are:
	Single - R250 per day
	Double - R350 per day
	Suite - R500 per day

If needed, an additional bed will be provided in the room for a charge of R50 per day. 

The Guest House requires a program which must work as follows:
	1. The name of the guest and the number of days of stay must be entered in text boxes
	2. The type of room must be selected using radio buttons
	3. A check box control must be used to select whether an additional bed is needed or not

When the form is first loaded, the double room must be selected and the additional bed must not be checked.

When the user clicks a CALCULATE button the program must do the following:
	1. Call a function to validate that the name contains only alphabetic characters and spaces. 
		(The name should not be composed only of spaces).
		A boolean value must be returned to the calling procedure.
		If the data is invalid, a message must be displayed and the cursor placed in the name text box.

	2. The program must validate that the number of days is numeric and not less than 1.
		If the data is invalid, a message must be displayed and the cursor placed in the number of days text box.

If all data is valid the program must:
	a. calculate and display the total daily charge by adding the charge for the room to the charge of the additional bed (if selected)
	b. calculate and display the total charge for the input number of days
	c. calculate and display the VAT amount (14% of the total charge)
	d. calculate and display the total charge including VAT

All displays must be in read-only text boxes.

The program must end when the user clicks an exit button.

DO THE FOLLOWING:
	1. Draw the GUI for the form. Show the name of each control.
	2. Write the VB program
