The 3rd and 4th characters of the South African id number indicate the month number that the person was born in. 

There are 12 months in a year and each month has a name.

Write the VB.Net code, including the header, for a sub procedure which must do the following:
a. Receive a string variable which contains an id number as a parameter. (You can assume the Id number has already been trimmed).
b. In a text box called txtMonth, display the name of the month (the English name) that the person was born in.

Note: Use any Sub procedure name.

Make sure that you declare all variables used inside your procedure.
