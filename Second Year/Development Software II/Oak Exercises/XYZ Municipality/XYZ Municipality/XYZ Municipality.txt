XYZ Municipality needs a program to calculate the property tax of the residents of that municipality. 			[43]

The property tax is calculated by adding a house tax to a land tax and subtracting a discount. 

	- The house tax is based on the area in square meters of the house
	- The land tax is based on the area in square meters of the land
	- The discount is based on the age of the house in years.


The house tax is calculated as follows
	House Area in square meters			Calculation of  House Tax
	Less than or equal to 100 			R10 per square meter
	Over 100 but less than or equal to 200		R1000 + R11 per square meter for area above 100 m2
	Over 200 but less than or equal to 300		R2100 + R12 per square meter for area above 200 m2
	Over 300 but less than or equal to 400		R3300 + R13 per square meter for area above 300 m2
	Over 400 but less than or equal to 500		R4600 + R14 per square meter for area above 400 m2
	Over 500					R6000 + R17 per square meter for area above 500 m2

	
	If the house is less than 5 years old then there is no discount. 
	If the age of the house is from 5 to 19 years, a discount of 7.5% is allowed. 
	If the house is 20 years or older, 25% discount is allowed.


The land tax is calculated as follows.
	Land Area in square meters			Calculation of Land Tax
	Less than or equal to 1000 			R1 per square meter
	Over 1000 but less than or equal to 2000	R1000 + R1.50 per square meter for area above 1000 m2
	Over 2000					R2500 + R2.50 per square meter for area above 2000 m2


	Get:
	- The name of the owner
	- Address of the owner
	- Area of house in square meters
	- Area of the land in square meters
	- The age of the house in years using text boxes.


The following validations needs to be done on the data when the user clicks a calculate button.
	• The area of the house must be numeric and must be greater than 0.
	• The area of the land must be numeric and must be greater than 0.
	• The age of the house must be numeric and must greater than 0.

If the data is invalid, give an error message and no further calculations must be done. 

If the data is valid, calculate and display the following in separate read only text boxes.
	• The tax for the house
	• The tax for the land
	• The discount
	• The total property tax for the year
	• The property tax payable every month

You need to format Rands showing the R symbol and with 2 decimal places.

When the user clicks exit button, end the program.
 
You are required to do the following.
	- Draw the Graphical User Interface for the program. Show the controls and label them.	[6]

	- Write the VB code for the calculate click event. 
	  If any form level variables need to be declared for the calculation, they must be shown above the click event procedure. 
	  
	If this procedure calls any user-defined procedure and/or function: 
		-You must also write the code for all such procedures and/or functions.
