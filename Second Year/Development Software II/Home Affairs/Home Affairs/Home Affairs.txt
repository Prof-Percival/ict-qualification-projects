Home Affairs in Butterworth is updating their system in which it has a textbox for the user to input the Identification number of the people.

A South African Identification number is a 13-digit number containing only numeric characters. 

It is defined by character sequence YYMMDDSSSSCAZ, the meaning of which is given below.
	YY represents the year of birth
	MM represents the month of birth
	DD represents the date of the birth in the month
	SSSS is a sequence number registered with the same birth date. 
	Females are assigned sequential numbers in the range 0000 to 4999
	Males from 5000 to 9999.
	C is the residential status with 0 if the person is a South African Citizen
					 1 if the person is a permanent resident
	A is 8 or 9.
	Z is a checksum digit.

When the user clicks a SHOW button, the program must call a sub procedure which validates and display the results.

The sub procedure receives the ID number as a string parameter (not trimmed) and validate the ID number as follows:
	The ID number must be exactly 13 digit characters. (Hint: Digit means only numeric values)
	The 11th digit must be 0 or 1
	The 12th digit must be 8 or 9

Display appropriate error message(s) if it is invalid.

If the data is valid:
	The sub procedure must display date of birth in the short date format, gender and residential status in three separate textboxes 
										(txtDoB, txtGender and txtResidentStatus) from the ID number.
	
	For example, if the ID Number is 8506205806192 the three text boxes must display the following
		20/06/1985
		Male
		Permanent Resident

	If the ID Number is 1107154356088 the text boxes must display the following.
		15/07/2011
		Female
		South African Citizen

ie. If YY is greater than or equal to 00 and less than or equal to 20, then the first two characters of year to be displayed is 20. 
	(For example: if YY is 03, then you will display 2003). 

    If YY is greater than 15 and less than or equal to 99, then the first two characters of year to be displayed is 19. 
	(For example: if YY is 21, then you will display 1921)

The program must end when he clicks an EXIT button.

	1. Draw the VB structure chart for the program.

	2. Write the VB code for the sub procedure.
