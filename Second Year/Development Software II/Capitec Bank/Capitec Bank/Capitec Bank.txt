Capitec bank needs a software for the smooth running of their business and they have asked you to develop a program.
Allow the user to input the ID, First name, last name, citizen and balance amount in separate text boxes. 

When the user clicks on SHOW button, the program must do the following validation
1. All input fields must not be empty
2. ID must have only numeric
3. ID must be exactly 13 digits
4. First Name must be alphabetic and may contain spaces but no other characters or numbers
5. Last Name must be alphabetic and may contain spaces but no other characters or numbers
6. Citizen must be alphabetic and may contain spaces but no other characters or numbers
7. Balance Amount must have only numeric
8. Balance Amount must be greater than 0

If any of the data is invalid,
Do not perform the calculation, Display the error message, Clear the invalid data and bring the Focus to the respective textbox. 
Display 0 as the output for Total Balance

If all the data is valid, then:
If the first two characters of ID is 55 or less:
Then the customer's monthly interest received rate will be 5 % of the balance amount, otherwise 3%.

Calculate and display the Total Balance in a read only textbox.

Total Balance can be calculated as (Total Balance + (Total Balance * rate))

When the user click on EXIT button, program must end
