A company called Wagga Technology repairs computer hardware. 

They generally charge R200.00 per hour for labour for a simple job (type 1) or R300.00 per hour for a more complex job (type 2). 

In addition to the labour charge, they also charge the client for the replacement parts needed. 

Vat of 15% is added to the final amount the customer must pay.

They want a program which will allow them to enter: 
	- The customer’s name
	- Job type (1 or 2)
	- The number of hours (this will be an integer)
	- The charge for the parts needed

All input data should be accepted through textboxes. For each job, the program must calculate and display the total charged (including VAT). 

The program must accumulate or count all required totals.

When the form loads the program should do the following
	All output textboxes must be set to read-only.
 
When the user clicks on a calculate button the program should
	- Call a separate Boolean function that takes customer name as parameter and validates the name contains alphabetic characters only.
	- Validate the job type, is either 1 or 2
	- Number of hours should be numeric and above zero

If the data is not valid display an appropriate error message

If the data is valid: 
	- The program must also calculate and display in read-only textboxes the following (Accumulated Totals) with meaningful messages: 
		I. The total charge for labour for type 1 jobs
		II. The total hours for labour for type 2 jobs
		III. The total charge for parts for all jobs
		IV. The total VAT amount for all jobs
		V. The total amount made by Wagga Technology for all repairs

When a Next Order Button is clicked
	- The program should call a general procedure that clear the customer’s name, job type and total

When an Exit Button is clicked 
	- The program should stop
