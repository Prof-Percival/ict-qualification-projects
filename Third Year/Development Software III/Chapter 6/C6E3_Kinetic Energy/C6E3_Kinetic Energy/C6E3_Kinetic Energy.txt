Kinetic Energy

In physics, an object that is in motion is said to have kinetic energy. 

The following formula can be used to determine a moving object’s kinetic energy:
		KE = (1/2) mv^2

In the formula KE is the kinetic energy, 
	m is the object’s mass in kilograms, and 
	v is the object’s velocity in meters per second. 

Create an application that allows the user to enter an object’s mass and velocity and then displays the object’s kinetic energy.

The application should have a method named KineticEnergy that accepts an object’s mass (in kilograms) and velocity (in meters per second) as arguments. 

The method should return the amount of kinetic energy that the object has.
