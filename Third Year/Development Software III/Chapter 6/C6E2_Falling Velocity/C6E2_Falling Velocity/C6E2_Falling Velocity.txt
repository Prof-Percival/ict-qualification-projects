Falling Velocity

When an object is falling because of gravity, the following formula can be used to determine the velocity of the falling object at a specified time:
		v = gt

The variables in the formula are as follows: v is the velocity in meters per second, 
					     g is 9.8, and t is the amount of time in seconds that the object has been falling. 

Create an application that allows the user to enter the amount of time that an object has fallen, and then displays the distance that the object fell. 

The application should have a function named FallingVelocity. 

The FallingVelocity function should accept an objectâ€™s falling time (in seconds) as an argument. 

The function should return the velocity (in meters per second) that the object has achieved during that time interval.
