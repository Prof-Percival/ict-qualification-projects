Converting Yen and Euros to U.S. Dollars

Your friend is working for a foreign exchange agency that helps tourists visiting the United States by converting Japanese yen and European euro to U.S. dollars. 

She asks a tourist the amount of foreign currency they want to convert, and then calculates the converted amount in U.S. dollars using the current rate of exchange 

	for JPY to USD as:
		1 JPY = 0.0098 USD

Similarly, she uses the current market rate for converting 

	EUR to USD as:
		1 EUR = 1.37 USD

Create an application that will make these calculations. In the application, you should have the following methods:

	• YenToUSD – This method should accept a currency value in yens as an argument and return its value in USD.
	
	• EuroToUSD–This method should accept a currency value in euros as an argument and return its value in USD.
