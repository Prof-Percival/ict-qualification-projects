Salesmen’s Commission Calculator

Create an application that lets the user enter a salesman’s revenue sale and the rate of commission paid by the company, and displays the commission earned. 

For example:
	• If a salesman sells $100,000 in revenue while working with a company that pays 5 percent of the revenue, his commission check will be $5,000.
	• If a salesman sells $100,000 in revenue while working with a company that pays 8 percent of the revenue, his commission check will be $8,000.

The program should have a method named CalculateCommission that receives the revenue sale by a salesman and the commission percentage as arguments, and 
returns the commission earned by the salesman.
