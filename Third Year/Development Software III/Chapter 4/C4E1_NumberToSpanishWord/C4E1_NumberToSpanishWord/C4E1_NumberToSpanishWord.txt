Spanish Version Number Converter

Create an application that allows the user to enter an integer between 1 and 10 into a TextBox control. 

The program should display the Spanish version of that number. 

If the number is outside the range of 1 through 10, the program should display an error message. 

The following table lists the Spanish versions for the numbers 1 through 10.
