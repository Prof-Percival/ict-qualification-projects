VIP Transport, which operates a car hire service in East London, requires a program which will track trips by its drivers. 

A trip is described by car id, destination and distance. 

The program is to calculate the total fare for each trip as follows: 

	if distance is <=20 kilometres, the fare payable R50.00; 
	if the distance is more than 20 kilometres, any additional kilometre is charged at R2.00

1. Draw a class Trip for the problem. Show the members of the class. 

2. Convert Trip to a Java program. (Your program should contain two constructors and get and set methods)

3. Create a class TestTrip which creates an instance of the class Trip and displays the information about a trip and the fare payable by a passenger. 

Output is shown below 

Car Id: car001
Destination: Ocean Villas
Distance: 150.0km
Total Fare payable: R310.0


EXERCISE â€“ 2
Alter the previous program(Exercise 1) by changing ONLY the third point.

3. Create a TestTrip class that creates three instances of the Trip class and display the following information on the screen.


Car Id: 007 BOND
Destination: Cape Town
Distance: 250.0Km
Total Fare payable: R510.0 

Car Id: 111 RAJ
Destination: Greenfields
Distance: 15.0Km
Total Fare payable: R50.0

Car Id: 111 JON
