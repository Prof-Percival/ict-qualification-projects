CheckingAccount: 
A checking account is a bank account. 

Therefore, it inherits all the properties of a bank account. 

Because one of the objectives of a checking account is to be able to write checks, we include the abstract method writeCheck to write checks. 


The UML class diagram for class CheckingAccount is shown in Figure 10-9 (p.629) D.S Malik
