ServiceChargeChecking: 

A service charge checking account is a checking account.

Therefore, it inherits all the properties of a checking account. 

For simplicity we assume that this type of account does not pay any interest, allows the account holder to write a limited number of checks each month, and does not require any minimum balance. 


The named constants, instance variables, and methods of this class are described in Figure 10-10, which also shows the UML class diagram of the class ServiceChargeChecking.
