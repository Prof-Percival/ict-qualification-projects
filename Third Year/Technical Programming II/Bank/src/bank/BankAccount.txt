BankAccount: 

Every bank account has an account number, the name of the owner, and a balance. 

Therefore, instance variables name, accountNumber, and balance are declared in the abstract class BankAccount. 

Some operations common to all types of accounts are to retrieve the account ownerâ€™s name, the account number, the account balance, make deposits, withdraw money, and create a monthly statement. 

So we include methods to implement these operations. 

Furthermore, some of these methods will be abstract. 

We also include the method toString to return the appropriate information about the class as a string.


The UML class diagram of the class BankAccount is shown in Figure 10-8 (p.628) D.S Malik
