10. Caitlyn’s Crafty Creations computes a retail price for each product as: 
	the cost of materials plus $12 multiplied by the number of hours of work required to create the product, plus $7 shipping and handling. 

Create a class that contains a main() method that prompts the user for:
	the name of a product (for example, “woven purse”)
	the cost of materials, and the number of hours of work required. 

Pass the numeric data to a method that computes the retail price of the product and returns the computed value to the main() method where the product name and price are displayed.
