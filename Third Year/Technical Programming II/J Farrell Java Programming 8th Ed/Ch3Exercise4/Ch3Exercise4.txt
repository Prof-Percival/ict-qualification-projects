4. 

a. Create an application named NumbersDemo whose main() method holds two integer variables. 
    Assign values to the variables. 
    In turn, pass each value to methods named:
        displayTwiceTheNumber()
        displayNumberPlusFive()
        displayNumberSquared().

    Create each method to perform the task its name implies.

    Save the application as NumbersDemo.java.

b. Modify the NumbersDemo class to accept the values of the two integers from a user at the keyboard.
    Save the file as NumbersDemo2.java.
